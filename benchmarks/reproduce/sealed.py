"""Read a result directory only through its judge seal.

Row count is not integrity. Opening `judged.jsonl` directly and recomputing the
metric from whatever verdicts are in it cannot distinguish an intact artifact
from one with a flipped verdict, two flipped verdicts that leave the aggregate
unchanged, or no `judge_manifest.json` at all. The seal records a digest for
every input and output of the judging round, so consulting it is what separates
those cases.

The release path therefore takes the same route a scorer takes with `--offline`:
verify every digest the seal records, and parse the bytes that verification
returned rather than re-opening the file.
